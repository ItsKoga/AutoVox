# AutoVox Bot

AutoVox is a personal project primarily focused on automatically managing voice channels by dynamically creating and deleting them, as well as assigning default roles. However, thatâ€™s just the beginning, as future plans include more advanced features for a streamlined Discord experience.


## Installation

To run AutoVox, you need to have Python 3.10+ and the `py-cord` library installed. Follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ItsKoga/AutoVox-bot.git
cd AutoVox-bot
```

### 2. install Dependencies
Use `pip` to install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following content:

**TOKEN:** The token for your Discord bot. You can get this from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
